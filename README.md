# website-template
This is the source of [flamex.dev](https://flamex.dev) made with React.

# Modify
To edit the displayed images, texts, cards and so on, you just need to edit the [`website-template/src/config.json`](https://github.com/flamexdev/website-template/blob/main/website-template/src/config.json).
Of course you can choose the hard way, editing the source, too.

Now run `npm run build` in your console.
Now you can see a new folder called `build`. This includes your website that ou need to host now.
